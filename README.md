# Wontwm - A tiling window manager configured with bash scripts and written in rust

## The names
Wontwm is pronounced as "wonton". The configuration program is called "wontdo" but it will do its job.

## Highlights
- Inspired by bspwm and herbstluftwm, wontwm is configured with the "wontdo" command, which can be put in any bash scripts, or invoked from any other languages.
- Inspired by dwm, wontwm uses the concept of tag for workspaces, which allows more dynamic control of workspaces and monitors.
- Written in rust, which means memory safe.
- Uses the modern and async xcb library (a rust binding) instead of xlib

## Work in progress
